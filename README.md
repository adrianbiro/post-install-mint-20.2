# post-install-mint-20.2
Post-installation script for Linux Mint 20.2.
Flatpak remarks:
The first three packages can be found in official repositories, all three are in some aspects obsolete, but Calibre from flatpak is definitely better, in the official repo is unmaintained. Libreoffice can be added via "sudo add-apt-repository ppa:libreoffice/ppa", but this isn't suitable for an average user.
